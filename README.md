# Web Editor with GrapeJS


This project is a simple web editor that utilizes GrapeJS, an open-source framework for creating dynamic web pages. With this editor, users can easily create and modify web pages using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Main Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily create custom layouts by dragging and dropping elements onto the canvas.
- **Predefined Components**: Access a wide variety of prebuilt components, such as buttons, images, and text blocks, to expedite the page creation process.
- **Customization**: Customize the appearance and behavior of elements by adjusting their styles, colors, and properties, providing flexibility and control over the design.
- **Export**: Export the HTML and CSS code of the created page, enabling seamless integration with other projects or platforms.

## Requirements

To run the web editor, you'll need:

- **Server**: A server to store information about templates and users. For this project, XAMPP was used as the local development environment.
- **Web Browser**: A modern web browser compatible with HTML5 and CSS3.


## What do I need?

- **XAMPP**: an Apache local server with MySQL database
- **Visual Studio Code / PHP Storm**: an IDE to launch the script to build the database


## Installation

No complex installation process is required to start using the editor. Simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlbertoPuggioni/web_editor_with_grapesjs.git
    ```
2. Run the `create_db.php` file to build the database with the proper tables.
   
3. Open the `main.php` file in your preferred web browser.

That's it! You're ready to start creating and editing web pages with GrapeJS.
